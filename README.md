# Toucan

This is a multi-project .Net Core template designed as a starting point for building an SPA application using SOLID principles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET Core 1.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/) (or a similar text-based editor like Sublime)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Installing

Update dependencies and build the .Dot Net based server projects by switching to the root directory of the solution and running

```
dotnet restore ./src
dotnet build ./src/server/project.json
```

Update dependencies and build the Nodejs based UI project by switching to ./src/ui and running

```
npm install
npm install webpack -g
npm install typings -g
typings install
webpack -p --config webpack/development.js
```


dotnet ef --startup-project ../server migrations add Initial -c MssqlContext
The final step is to update the configuration file *./src/server/app.development.json*. Edit *data:connectionString* configuration key to point to a local (or remote) instance of SQL server.

Entity Framework migrations code will then create and seed the database upon server startup.

```
    "data": {
      "connectionString": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ToucanDevelopment;Trusted_Connection=True;"
    }
```

You should now be able to start the server by switching to ./src/server and running

```
dotnet run -p ./src/server/project.json -c Development
```

## Running the tests
